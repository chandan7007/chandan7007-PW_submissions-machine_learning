    "- Binary Data: Bernoulli Naive Bayes is typically used for binary or Boolean features, where each feature can take only one of two possible values (usually 0 or 1). It's suitable for situations where you want to model the presence or absence of certain features.\n",
    "- Document Classification: It is commonly used in text classification tasks, where each word is treated as a feature, and the presence or absence of a word in a document is considered.\n",
    "- Assumption: It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label (hence the \"Naive\" in Naive Bayes), and it calculates the likelihood of a document belonging to a particular class based on the presence or absence of certain words/features.\n",
    "2. Multinomial Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Count Data: Multinomial Naive Bayes is suitable for discrete count data, where features represent counts or frequencies of events. This is commonly used for text classification when considering the frequency of words in a document.\n",

    "Bernoulli Naive Bayes, like other Naive Bayes variants, handles missing values in a specific way due to its assumption of conditional independence between features given the class label. When dealing with missing values in Bernoulli Naive Bayes, there are a few common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ignoring Missing Values: One straightforward approach is to simply ignore instances with missing values during training and classification. This can work if the missing values are relatively rare and randomly distributed across the dataset. However, this approach may lead to information loss, especially if missing values are not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Imputation: Another approach is to impute missing values with either the most common value (0 or 1) for the respective feature in the given class or some other method appropriate for binary data. Imputation can help retain information from instances with missing values, but it may introduce biases if the imputation method is not carefully chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Special Category: You can treat missing values as a separate category or value for each feature. This means creating an additional category (say, \"missing\") for each feature and assigning missing values to this category. This approach explicitly accounts for missingness in the data, but it can also increase the dimensionality of the feature space."
